# CarRentalSystem
The Car Rental System is designed to provide a smooth and efficient car renting experience for users. The process begins with user registration, where the user is required to input personal details to create an account. Once registered, the user can browse through a list of available cars and select a car of their choice based on preferences such as model, type, and availability.
After selecting a car, the user specifies the number of days they wish to rent the vehicle. The system then calculates the estimated rental cost based on the car type and rental duration.
Upon return of the car, the system prompts the user to provide the following information:
Fuel Level: The user reports the current fuel level of the car.
Odometer Reading: The system records the final odometer reading to calculate the distance traveled.
Damage Report: The user is asked if there are any visible damages or issues with the car.
Based on the return details, the system may apply additional charges for:
Low fuel levels
Extra mileage beyond the agreed limit
Any reported or detected damage
Finally, the system generates a final bill and thanks the user for using the service. The process then exits, and the system resets for the next user.
